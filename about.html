        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Take It To The Streets is a nonprofit organization aimed to help 
          motorists contest and win appeals on parking ticket violations in
          the City of Chicago. Our goal is to education people on how to
          appeal and win in court.

        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <p>
          Often times, motorists default their actions on paying the violation 
          ticket rather than disputing it in court. However, some motorists
          cannot afford to pay the ticket because they have other fees to pay
          like the annual city sticker that would cost around $50-$200
          depending on the vehicle.
